# Finite-Difference-Heat-Conduction-in-Python
This project implements the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for steady-state heat conduction in a thick cylindrical shell. The cylinder is immersed in a hot bath while a fluid with a lower temperature flows through it.
