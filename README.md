# Finite Difference Method for Steady-State Heat Conduction in a Thick Cylinder

This project implements the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for steady-state heat conduction in a thick cylindrical shell. The cylinder is immersed in a hot bath while a fluid with a lower temperature flows through it. This setup allows for the comparison of numerical and analytical solutions of the temperature profile across the thickness of the cylinder.
