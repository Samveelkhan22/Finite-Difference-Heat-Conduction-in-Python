# Finite Difference Method for Steady-State Heat Conduction in a Thick Cylinder

This project implements the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for steady-state heat conduction in a thick cylindrical shell. The cylinder is immersed in a hot bath while a fluid with a lower temperature flows through it. This setup allows for the comparison of numerical and analytical solutions of the temperature profile across the thickness of the cylinder.

## Project Overview

This project includes:
1. A finite difference approach to solve the BVP for the temperature profile in the cylinder.
2. An analytical solution for comparison.
3. A plot showing both the numerical and analytical solutions.

## Results
The plot generated shows:

- The Numerical Solution (obtained using the Finite Difference Method) as a series of discrete points.
- The Analytical Solution as a continuous line for comparison.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib
